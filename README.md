# Supervised Machine Learning - Predicting Credit Risk

## Background

Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. 

Created machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans and compared the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

-------

Created and compared two models on the data: a logistic regression, and a random forests classifier. Fit and scored the models and made a prediction as to which model performed better.

* Created a LogisticRegression model and RandomForestClassifier, fit it to the data, and printed the models scores.
